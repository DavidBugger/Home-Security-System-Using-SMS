Instructions 
# Arduino Code README

This repository contains Arduino code for a specific project. Follow the instructions below to simulate the code on the Arduino Web Editor and deploy it on a physical Arduino board.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino Web Editor: To simulate and deploy the code online, you need to have an account on the Arduino Web Editor. If you don't have an account, you can create one at https://create.arduino.cc/editor.

## Steps to Simulate the Code on Arduino Web Editor

1. Log in to your Arduino Web Editor account at https://create.arduino.cc/editor.

2. Create a new sketch by clicking on "Create New Sketch".

3. Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the editor.

4. Click on the "Verify" button to compile the code. Make sure there are no errors or warnings in the compilation output.

5. If the code compiles successfully, click on the "Simulate" button to open the virtual simulation environment.

6. In the simulation environment, you can interact with the virtual components and test the behavior of your code.

7. Follow the instructions provided by the simulation environment to simulate the inputs and observe the outputs of your code.

## Steps to Deploy the Code on a Physical Arduino Board

1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

2. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Arduino website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.

3. Click on "File" > "New" to open a new sketch.

4. Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the new sketch.

5. Select the appropriate board model under "Tools" > "Board". Choose the correct board type for your Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, etc.).

6. Select the port to which your Arduino board is connected under "Tools" > "Port". Choose the port that represents your Arduino board (e.g., COM1, /dev/cu.usbmodem1411, etc.).

7. Click on the "Upload" button (or select "Sketch" > "Upload") to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

8. Wait for the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code. The status will change to "Done" when the upload is complete.

9. Once the upload is successful, the code will start running on your Arduino board.

10. Test the behavior of your code by connecting the appropriate components (sensors, actuators, etc.) to the Arduino board according to your project requirements.

11. Power the Arduino board using an appropriate power source (batteries, power supply).

12. Make sure that the Arduino board is correctly connected to the components and power supply.

13. Verify that the deployed setup functions as expected.
